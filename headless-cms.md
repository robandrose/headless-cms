# Headless CMS 

After constantly beeing pushed away from Dato CMS due to their ever changing price-model, we are in need of a better and foremost more secure alternative to build upon. We need a Headless CMS as a basis for our Client-Websites, built on React/Next.js/Apollo 

## Prerequisites:
* Graphql API
* Price less than 30â‚¬ per Project/Month
* Nice and intuitive Interface
* Good solution to handle Images and resizing (on the fly) like for instance https://www.imgix.com/
* Being able to build new Content-Models on the fly
* Data write Api, to easily transfer content in and out
* Localisations with up to 13 locales possible at a reasonable price
* "Slice" like contentelements, making it easy to create very unique contentelements. Best would be the ability to nest these structures infinitely (unless prismic or dato, where )
* Treelike Structures for nested pagetrees
